Project Digit Recognition with RNN (Recurrent Neural Net with LSTM)

Digit Recognition with RNN (Recurrent Neural Net with LSTM)
Apr 2018 â€“ May 2018
Project description-Created a recurrent neural net with 98% accuracy
-Used Mnist dataset from tensorflow
-Used LSTM (RNN cell)
-Reshaped the data, in order to fit in RNN Cell 
-Ran it for 10 epoch, got 98% accuracy.
-Used CPU not the GPU

Environment:
1) Pycharm by jet brains 
2) Sublime text editor
3) Debian terminal(Unix like operating system)

Stack:
1) Tensorflow v1.6(Mnist data sets,RNN cell, LSTM,AdamOptimisers,CrossEntropy)
2) Python3+
3) Unix
