Project Digit Recognition with RNN (Recurrent Neural Net with LSTM)

Digit Recognition with RNN (Recurrent Neural Net with LSTM)
Apr 2018 – May 2018
Project description-Created a recurrent neural net with 98% accuracy:

a) Used Mnist dataset from tensorflow.
b) Used LSTM (RNN cell).
c) Reshaped the data, in order to fit in RNN Cell .
d) Ran it for 10 epoch, got 98% accuracy.
e) Used CPU not the GPU.

Environment:
1) Pycharm by jet brains 
2) Sublime text editor
3) Debian terminal(Unix like operating system)

Stack:
1) Tensorflow v1.6(Mnist data sets,RNN cell, LSTM,AdamOptimisers,CrossEntropy)
2) Python3+
3) Unix
